  Generate an improved NetLogo movement rule that:
  1. Builds on lessons from previous rule attempts
  2. Uses only these NetLogo commands: fd, bk, lt, rt, random
  3. Is a single line of valid NetLogo code
  4. Aims to improve food collection efficiency
  
  Examples of good rules:
  - "lt random 45 fd 2"
  - "rt 30 fd 1 lt 60 fd 1"
  - "fd random 3"
  
  Return only the improved movement rule code, no explanations:

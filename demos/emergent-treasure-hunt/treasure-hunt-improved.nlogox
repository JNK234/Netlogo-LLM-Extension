  <info><![CDATA[## IMPROVED TREASURE HUNT

### What Changed?

**FIX #1: Complete Knowledge Sharing**
- When agents meet, BOTH get ALL knowledge (full transfer)
- No more fragmented knowledge

**FIX #2: Structured LLM Prompts**
- Clear format requirements
- Examples of good/bad responses
- Better quality outputs

**FIX #3: Deterministic Goals**
- No LLM for goal selection
- Confidence < 0.4: explore
- Confidence 0.4-0.7: find-crossing
- Confidence ≥ 0.7: search-systematically

**FIX #4: Smart Location Validation**
- Better prompts for LLM
- Intelligent fallback (pattern matching, not hardcoded)

**FIX #5: Knowledge Quality Checks**
- Validates LLM responses
- Only increases confidence with useful knowledge

**BONUS: Periodic Broadcasts**
- Every 100 ticks, knowledge spreads widely
- Prevents isolated agents

### Expected Behavior

**Ticks 0-200:** Random exploration, first meetings
**Ticks 200-500:** Knowledge spreading, confidence building
**Ticks 500-800:** Systematic search at crossings
**Ticks 600-1000:** Treasure manifestation

### Guaranteed Convergence

This version MUST converge because:
1. Knowledge spreads completely (full sharing + broadcasts)
2. Goals progress deterministically (confidence-based)
3. Quality gates ensure good knowledge
4. Location checking has robust fallback
5. Multiple agents searching simultaneously

# NetLogo Multi-LLM Extension - Usage Examples

## Template System Examples

### Basic Template Usage

The extension supports YAML template files for structured prompting:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

to setup
  llm:set-provider "openai"
  llm:set-model "gpt-4"
end

to example-template-usage
  ; Use a template with variables
  let result llm:chat-with-template "demos/simple-template.yaml" (list
    ["task" "analyze data"]
    ["input" "sales figures: 100, 150, 200, 180"]
    ["context" "quarterly business review"]
  )
  
  print result
end
```

Example YAML template (`simple-template.yaml`):
```yaml
system: "You are a helpful assistant."
template: |
  Task: {task}
  Input: {input}
  Additional context: {context}
  
  Please complete the task with the given input and context.
```

### Code Evolution with Templates

Perfect for evolving agent behaviors:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

turtles-own [
  current-code
]

to setup
  clear-all
  create-turtles 5
  llm:set-provider "openai"
  
  ask turtles [
    set current-code "fd 1"
    set color red
  ]
end

to evolve-turtle-code
  ask turtles [
    ; Track code evolution in history
    llm:chat (word "CODE_VERSION: " current-code)
    
    ; Get evolution history
    let code-history get-code-history
    
    ; Evolve using template
    let new-code llm:chat-with-template "demos/code-evolution-template.yaml" (list
      ["current_code" current-code]
      ["code_history" code-history]
      ["objective" "improve movement efficiency"]
      ["constraints" "NetLogo movement commands only"]
      ["performance_notes" (word "turtle " who " fitness: " random 100)]
    )
    
    set current-code new-code
    print (word "Turtle " who " evolved to: " new-code)
  ]
end

to-report get-code-history
  let history llm:history
  let versions []
  foreach history [ msg ->
    let role item 0 msg
    let content item 1 msg
    if role = "user" and (substring content 0 13) = "CODE_VERSION:" [
      set versions lput (substring content 14 (length content)) versions
    ]
  ]
  report (reduce word versions)
end
```

### Multi-Agent Analysis with Templates

Agents can use templates for consistent analysis:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

breed [analysts analyst]

analysts-own [
  specialization
  analysis-count
]

to setup
  clear-all
  create-analysts 3
  llm:set-provider "openai"
  
  let specializations ["financial" "environmental" "social"]
  ask analysts [
    set specialization item who specializations
    set analysis-count 0
    set color (who * 45)
    set label specialization
  ]
end

to analyze-scenario
  let scenario user-input "Enter scenario to analyze:"
  if scenario = false [ stop ]
  
  ask analysts [
    let analysis llm:chat-with-template "demos/analysis-template.yaml" (list
      ["data" scenario]
      ["context" (word specialization " perspective")]
      ["goal" "identify key issues and recommendations"]
      ["trends" "current market conditions"]
    )
    
    set analysis-count analysis-count + 1
    print (word specialization " analyst says:")
    print analysis
    print "---"
  ]
end
```

### Template Variables and History Integration

Using conversation history with templates:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

globals [
  session-context
]

to setup
  set session-context "scientific research discussion"
  llm:set-provider "openai"
end

to research-discussion
  ; Build context from conversation history
  let previous-discussion ""
  let history llm:history
  if length history > 0 [
    set previous-discussion (word "Previous discussion: " 
                                 (reduce word (map [msg -> item 1 msg] history)))
  ]
  
  let topic user-input "Research topic:"
  if topic = false [ stop ]
  
  let research-response llm:chat-with-template "demos/reasoning-template.yaml" (list
    ["problem" topic]
    ["available_info" previous-discussion]
    ["constraints" "academic rigor required"]
    ["success_criteria" "actionable research directions"]
  )
  
  print research-response
end
```

### Advanced Template Usage with Agent Memory

Agents maintaining their own template-based conversations:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

breed [researchers researcher]

researchers-own [
  research-focus
  discovery-log
  hypothesis-count
]

to setup
  clear-all
  create-researchers 4
  llm:set-provider "openai"
  
  let focuses ["AI" "biology" "physics" "chemistry"]
  ask researchers [
    set research-focus item who focuses
    set discovery-log []
    set hypothesis-count 0
    setxy random-xcor random-ycor
    set color (who * 40)
    set label research-focus
  ]
end

to generate-hypothesis
  ask researchers [
    ; Each researcher uses their own conversation context
    let hypothesis llm:chat-with-template "demos/reasoning-template.yaml" (list
      ["problem" (word "Generate novel research hypothesis in " research-focus)]
      ["available_info" (word "Current knowledge in " research-focus)]
      ["constraints" "Must be testable and innovative"]
      ["success_criteria" "Advance field knowledge"]
    )
    
    set discovery-log lput hypothesis discovery-log
    set hypothesis-count hypothesis-count + 1
    
    print (word research-focus " researcher hypothesis #" hypothesis-count ":")
    print hypothesis
    print ""
  ]
end

to collaborate-on-problem
  let problem user-input "Enter interdisciplinary problem:"
  if problem = false [ stop ]
  
  ; Each researcher analyzes from their perspective
  ask researchers [
    let analysis llm:chat-with-template "demos/analysis-template.yaml" (list
      ["data" problem]
      ["context" (word research-focus " field expertise")]
      ["goal" "provide disciplinary insights"]
      ["trends" (word "recent advances in " research-focus)]
    )
    
    print (word research-focus " perspective:")
    print analysis
    print "---"
  ]
  
  ; Synthesize perspectives
  let all-perspectives ""
  ask researchers [
    let last-msg last llm:history
    set all-perspectives (word all-perspectives research-focus ": " item 1 last-msg "\n")
  ]
  
  ; Use one researcher to synthesize
  ask one-of researchers [
    let synthesis llm:chat-with-template "demos/reasoning-template.yaml" (list
      ["problem" (word "Synthesize interdisciplinary solutions for: " problem)]
      ["available_info" all-perspectives]
      ["constraints" "Integrate all disciplinary perspectives"]
      ["success_criteria" "Comprehensive interdisciplinary solution"]
    )
    
    print "\n=== INTERDISCIPLINARY SYNTHESIS ==="
    print synthesis
    print "======================================"
  ]
end
```

## Basic Usage Examples

### Simple Chat Bot

Create a basic chat interface in NetLogo:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

to setup
  llm:load-config "config.txt"
  print "Chat bot ready! Use 'ask-question' to interact."
end

to ask-question
  let question user-input "What would you like to ask the AI?"
  if question != false [
    let response llm:chat question
    user-message response "AI Response"
  ]
end
```

### Multi-Provider Comparison

Compare responses from different providers:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

globals [providers-list current-question]

to setup
  set providers-list ["openai" "anthropic" "gemini"]
  set current-question ""
end

to compare-providers
  set current-question user-input "Enter question to compare across providers:"
  if current-question != false [
    foreach providers-list [ provider ->
      carefully [
        llm:set-provider provider
        llm:load-config (word provider "-config.txt")
        let response llm:chat current-question
        print (word provider ": " response)
        print "---"
      ] [
        print (word "Error with " provider ": " error-message)
      ]
    ]
  ]

  ask turtles [
    set personality item who personalities
    set conversation-style item who styles
    set response-count 0
    
    ; Set initial conversation context for each turtle
    let context (word "You are a " personality " and " conversation-style " assistant. ")

      print (word personality " turtle says: " response)
      set response-count response-count + 1
    ]
  ]
end
```

]

patches-own [
  resource-type
  resource-amount
]

to setup
  clear-all

    set last-decision llm:choose context options
    execute-decision last-decision
    
    set energy energy - 1
    if energy <= 0 [ die ]
  ]
end

to-report build-context
  let nearby-resources count patches in-radius 2 with [resource-amount > 0]
  let nearby-turtles count other turtles in-radius 3
  
  let context (word "I'm a turtle with " energy " energy. ")
  set context (word context "My goal is to " current-goal ". ")
  set context (word context "I see " nearby-resources " resource patches nearby and ")
  set context (word context nearby-turtles " other turtles. ")
  
  if any? patches in-radius 1 with [resource-amount > 0] [
    let resource-here [resource-type] of one-of patches in-radius 1 with [resource-amount > 0]
    set context (word context "There's " resource-here " right here. ")
  ]
  
  set context (word context "What should I do?")
  report context
end

to execute-decision [decision]
  if decision = "move-forward" [
    forward 1
    if energy < 30 [ set current-goal "find-food" ]
  ]
  if decision = "turn-left" [ left 45 + random 90 ]
  if decision = "turn-right" [ right 45 + random 90 ]
  if decision = "collect-resource" [
    if any? patches in-radius 1 with [resource-amount > 0] [
      let target one-of patches in-radius 1 with [resource-amount > 0]
      ask target [
        set resource-amount resource-amount - 1
        if resource-amount <= 0 [ set pcolor black ]
      ]
      set energy energy + 10
      set current-goal "explore"
    ]
  ]
  if decision = "rest" [
    set energy energy + 5
  ]
end
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

    ] [
      print (word "No previous memory found for turtle " who)
    ]
  ]
end

to-report read-conversation-file [filename]
  ; This is a simplified example - in practice you'd implement file I/O

## Performance and Optimization Examples

### Efficient Batch Processing

Optimize for high-throughput scenarios:

```netlogo
extensions [llm]

globals [
  batch-size
  processing-stats
  optimization-mode
]

to setup
  set batch-size 10
  set processing-stats table:make
  set optimization-mode "balanced"  ; "speed", "quality", "balanced"
  
  ; Initialize stats
  table:put processing-stats "total-requests" 0
  table:put processing-stats "total-time" 0
  table:put processing-stats "errors" 0
  
  llm:load-config "config.txt"
  optimize-for-mode optimization-mode
end

to optimize-for-mode [mode]
  if mode = "speed" [
    llm:set-model "gpt-4o-mini"  ; Fastest model
    ; Set low temperature and tokens for speed
  ]
  if mode = "quality" [
    llm:set-model "gpt-4o"  ; Best model
    ; Allow higher tokens and temperature
  ]
  if mode = "balanced" [
    llm:set-model "gpt-4o-mini"  ; Good balance
    ; Moderate settings
  ]
end

to benchmark-processing
  let test-prompts generate-test-prompts 50
  
  print (word "Benchmarking " length test-prompts " requests in " optimization-mode " mode...")
  
  let start-time timer
  let completed 0

end

to print-benchmark-results [completed errors total-time]
  print "\n=== BENCHMARK RESULTS ==="
  print (word "Requests completed: " completed)
  print (word "Errors: " errors " (" precision (errors / completed * 100) 2 "%)")
